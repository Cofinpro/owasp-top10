# Presentation in Cofinpro Style in Reveal.js

## Starting the Presentation locally

1. install needed dep.s (momentarily just `live-server`)
  ```bash
  npm ci # or if you really want to `npm install`
  ```

2. start the http-server to serve the presentation
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

then open in chrome-based(!!) browsers (some css shenanigans are not yet supported in ffox)
